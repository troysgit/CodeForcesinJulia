These are my attempts at going through the CodeForce problemset found here:

https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC

My motivation for attempting these is to develop skills in Julia that are closer
to 'programming' compared to the 'advanced-calculator-style-scripting' that
being an R user can sometimes feel like. 

I will not be dedicating as much time to this project relative to other 
applied biological projects.
